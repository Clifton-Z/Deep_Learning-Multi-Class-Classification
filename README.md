## **üê∂ Using Transfer Learning and TensorFlow 2.0 to Classify Different Dog Breeds**

# Multi-class Dog Breed Classification

This notebook builds an end-to-end multi-class image classifier using TensorFlow 2.x and TensorFlow Hub.

## 1. Problem

Identifying the breed of a dog given an image of a dog.

When I'm sitting at the cafe and I take a photo of a dog, I want to know what breed of dog it is.

## 2. Data

The data we're using is from Kaggle's dog breed identification competition.

## 3. Evaluation

The evaluation is a file with prediction probabilities for each dog breed of each test image.

## 4. Features

Some information about the data:
* We're dealing with images (unstructured data) so it's probably best we use deep learning/transfer learning.
* There are 120 breeds of dogs (this means there are 120 different classes).
* There are around 10,000+ images in the training set (these images have labels).
* There are around 10,000+ images in the test set (these images have no labels, because we'll want to predict them). 




Who's that doggy in the window?

Dogs are incredible. But have you ever been sitting at a cafe, seen a dog and not known what breed it is? I have. And then someone says, "it's an English Terrier" and you think, how did they know that?

In this project we're going to be using machine learning to help us identify different breeds of dogs.

To do this, we'll be using data from the Kaggle dog breed identification competition. It consists of a collection of 10,000+ labelled images of 120 different dog breeds.

This kind of problem is called multi-class image classification. It's multi-class because we're trying to classify mutliple different breeds of dog. If we were only trying to classify dogs versus cats, it would be called binary classification (one thing versus another).

Multi-class image classification is an important problem because it's the same kind of technology Tesla uses in their self-driving cars or Airbnb uses in atuomatically adding information to their listings.

Since the most important step in a deep learng problem is getting the data ready (turning it into numbers), that's what we're going to start with.

We're going to go through the following TensorFlow/Deep Learning workflow:
1. Get data ready (download from Kaggle, store, import).
2. Prepare the data (preprocessing, the 3 sets, X & y).
3. Choose and fit/train a model ([TensorFlow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub), `tf.keras.applications`, [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard), [EarlyStopping](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/EarlyStopping)).
4. Evaluating a model (making predictions, comparing them with the ground truth labels).
5. Improve the model through experimentation (start with 1000 images, make sure it works, increase the number of images).
6. Save, sharing and reloading your model (once you're happy with the results).

For our machine learning model, we're going to be using a pretrained deep learning model from TensorFlow Hub.

The process of using a pretrained model and adapting it to your own problem is called transfer learning. We do this because rather than train our own model from scratch (could be timely and expensive), we leverage the patterns of another model which has been trained to classify images.
